    "Welcome to the first part of the SQL tutorial! We are happy to see you here :) In this notebook, you will learn the basic syntax of a SQL query, and begin to navigate a database to get the information you need. Once you've finished, you will be able to specify what kind of data you want from any database you have on hand. As with all unknown things, this is going to be an adventure - but no worries, since you already worked up the courage to be here, you'll be just fine :)\n",
