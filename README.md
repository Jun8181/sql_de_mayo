## Contents
**[installation_and_setup](https://github.com/timothydnguyen/SQL_de_Mayo/tree/master/installation_and_setup)** covers the process of getting up and running with PostgreSQL and Jupyter. Participants install those tools, configure a local database, and load it with data to be used in the workshop.

**[beginner](https://github.com/timothydnguyen/SQL_de_Mayo/tree/master/beginner)** is focused on introducing participants to the concept of databases as well as the SQL syntax. Participants will learn about the properties of tabular data and relational databases. Additionally, this section focuses on the fundamentals of SQL querying including SELECT statements, conditioning, and aliasing.

**[intermediate](https://github.com/timothydnguyen/SQL_de_Mayo/tree/master/intermediate)** focuses on practically applying the concepts learned in the `beginner` session in various realistic scenarios.  This introduces additional SQL concepts such as joins and database creation.
