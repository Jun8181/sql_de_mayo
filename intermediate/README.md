# Background

One of the biggest issues beginning SQL writers have is being able to write queries that use more than one table, which can be solved with a join. In this section, we are going to show you how to write a query that combines, or joins, data from more than one table. Once you have gone through the examples you will understand how to write the basic commands to make this happen and why data is separated in the first place. This image below walks through the different types of joins and how they work individually.

# Why Combine Data?

When databases are developed, care is taken to ensure redundant data is minimized.  The databases go through a process called normalization that help reduce each database table to a single meaning or purpose.

Suppose we have a database for all the companies in Santa Barbara. We have two different tables: companies and positions. The names table contains the columns company_name, and employee_id, a unique number assigned to each employee. The employee table contains the columns employee_id, name, and the position.

Note that there are some missing rows from both tables - Appfolio's' employee information is missing from the Positions table, and a row with employee_id hc_18 is missing from the Companies table.

#### Companies
Company_Name | Employee_Id |
--- | --- |
Carpe Data | tn_19 |
Invoca | rw_20 |
Impact Radius | lm_20 |
Appfolio | jr_21 |
HG Data | dr_16 |

#### Positions
Employee_Id | Name | Position |
--- | --- | --- |
tn_19 | Timmy | Data Scientist Intern
rw_20 | Richa | Software Engineer |
hc_18 | Holly | Financial Analyst
dr_16 | Daniel | Actuarial Analyst
lm_20 | Leslie | Consultant

To compute the company of Daniel the Actuarial Analyst, we have to use information in both tables. We can merge the tables on the employee_id column, creating a new table with both company name and position. To do so, we'll need to use a SQL join.

Database joins are used to match rows between tables to allow us to stitch the database back together to make it easy to read and use.  In most cases weâ€™re matching a column value from one table with another.

In this section we'll work together to explore all the different joins that exist in SQL.
